1)Designed and configured a complex network with 15 hosts, 4 routers, 2 wireless routers, 3 switches, 4 sensors, 1 fan, 2 LEDs, 2 VoIP phones, and 2 servers. Implemented protocols including RIP, OSPF, NAT, DHCP, NTP, and EIGRP, utilizing Class A, B, and C IP addresses.

2)Validated network connectivity by displaying a custom message via a web browser on PC 0 connected to Server 0 and successfully accessed files on Server 1 using FTP from PC 14.

3)Executed advanced router and switch configurations, including storing Router 3's configuration in secondary memory, adjusting Router 2's Hello Interval timer to 20 seconds, managing OSPF settings on Router 4, and configuring switch port security to enhance network protection.

4)Monitored network performance by displaying routing tables for all routers, resetting OSPF counters on Router 4, and demonstrating the principles and effectiveness of switch port security in preventing unauthorized access.
